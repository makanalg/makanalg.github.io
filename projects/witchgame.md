## The Game
I created a game where the player is a witch who moves around the map seperated by walls and needs to avoid zombies. The player can place portals and teleport to a random location around the map. If the zombies step in the portal they will also be teleported to a random location around the map. The zombies constantly move toward the player and the game ends when the player touches a zombie. 

## Not So Easy
It was a little challenging at first trying to figure out how to create the "walls" or boundaries in the game (sometimes the zombies would get stuck along the walls and wouldn't continue moving toward the player). After careful analysis of my code I was able to come up with a solution so that the game could run flawlessly. It was a great learning experience that helped to expand my critical thinking skills. Coding isn't always easy and won't always be easy so having a challenging project and being able to overcome it I feel is a great way to improve any skill. I look forward to the many more challenges that coding and software engineering brings.
