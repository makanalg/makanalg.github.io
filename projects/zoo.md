I volunteered at the Honolulu Zoo as a "Docent Talker" from 2019-2020. I spoke with many different visitors about the different animals at the zoo. This was a great opportunity to not only learn new things about the animals and the environment, but also to connect with others. Communication is a very important aspect in life and I feel that this was a great opportunity to strengthen communication skills as well as meet new people.
