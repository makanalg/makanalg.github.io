I volunteered at the Honolulu Zoo as a "Docent Talker" from 2019-2020. I spoke with many different visitors about the different animals at the zoo. This was a great opportunity to not only learn new things about the animals and the environment, but also to connect with others. Communication is a very important aspect in not only business, but in life. I feel that this was a great opportunity to strengthen communication skills as well as meet new people. 

Who you know could be a deciding factor on whether or not you get that job you desire. By having this opportunity to meet with a wide range of individuals I can expand my network and potentially meet with someone who is hiring at a high-paying job. Although it's a zoo and people are there to see animals, the volunteer opportunity allowed me to speak with people from different aspects of life so I'm able to gain an understanding of different perspectives when speaking with people. Being exposed to multiple perspectives I feel is what contributes to someone being a more well-rounded person and I think that being well-rounded is a great attribute to have any high-tech setting.
