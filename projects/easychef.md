## Overview
I, along with three others, created a website called [EasyChef](https://easychef.xyz/#/) that allowed users to upload budget-friendly and simple recipes that required minimal tools. The website is targeted toward college students who are looking for cost-effective meals that are tasty and can be made easily. 

## Development
The project was implemented using Semantic UI React and Meteor. MongoDB was used to handle the database. 
For more information, please view our [Github Organization Page](https://easy-chef.github.io/) and the [project source code](https://github.com/easy-chef/easy-chef).

## My Contribution
My contribution to this project include the development of the User Profile Page, Vendor Home Page, View Vendors Page, and the visuals of the overall site. 

### User Profile Implementation
The User Profile Implementation included both the View Profile Page and the Edit Profile Page. The user is able to edit their Name, Image, and Bio with the Edit Profile Page and is able to view their profile with the View Profile Page.

### Vendor Home Page Implementation
The Vendor Home Page Implementation allow users with the vendor role to access the View Ingredients Page and the Add Ingredients Page. The Add Ingredients Page lets vendors fill out a form and input the name, price, size, and quantity of the ingredient they have available. The View Ingredients Page lets vendors view a list of the current ingredients they have added and allows them to easily edit or delete ingredients. The ingredients that vendors upload have implementations with the recipe aspect of the website that calculate estimated costs. 

### View Vendors Implementation
The View Vendors Page allow anyone visiting the site to view a list of certified vendors. You do not need to be logged in to view the list of vendors, unlike many of the other features of the website. The View Vendors Page display information about each vendor including their name, store hours, bio, address, and email. I originally planned to add a View Inventory feature to each of the vendor cards on the View Vendors page but unfortunately I was not able to complete it. 

### Visual Updates Implementation
After receiving community feedback about the home page of our website being plain, I decided to update the overall visuals of the site. I changed the colors to be more visually appealing, modified the NavBar selection, and added more to the home page. 

## Takeaways
I learned a lot.
