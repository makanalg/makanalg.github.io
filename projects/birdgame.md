## The Game
I created a game similar to the popular Flappy Bird game where you press a button to make the bird jump and you as the player needs to try and avoid the balloons. The game keeps track of the current score as well as the previous score. Prior to my ICS 111 class in 2018, I had no coding experience. Despite everything being completely new to me, it still felt natural and I think it was a great learning experience. It was a great introduction to the world of coding and it definitely increased my interest in the subject. I look forward to creating a more sophisticated game one day. 

## Outcome
After creating this game, I felt like I wanted to create more. It was a great introduction to the world of coding and it made me want to pursue it as a career. The possibilities seem endless and technology is only going to advance even more. Java was a great language to start off learning as well since the code is very explicit and easy to follow in my opinion.
