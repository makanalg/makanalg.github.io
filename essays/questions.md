## It doesnâ€™t hurt to ask.. if you do it right
We live in a world where we have access to a plethora of information online. We can learn almost anything we want on the internet, for free. If you ask someone a question that you could've easily figured out through a simple google search, that person may be reluctant to help you. It's important that you display effort rather than seeming like you want to be spoon-fed answers. When it comes to software engineering, having questions is inevitable. It's important that you ask questions the "smart" so that you prevent annoying others by seeming lazy or uneducated. 

Ask questions at the relevant place, whether it forums, emails, or anything else. Ensure that your questions are related to the overall conversation of the place where you're asking. Use meaningful headers. Write clear, grammmatical, correctly-spelled language. Get to the point and be explicit about your question. Most importantly, show that you have made an effort to solve the problem prior to asking your question. People will be much more likely to help you if they see that you are willing to put in the effort to learn rather than to just be fed answers. 

## Learn from the mistakes of others
We can see examples of not so smart questions vs. smart questions on one of the most popular question and answer resource for programmers, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).
