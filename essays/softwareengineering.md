## Learning and Growing
I've come along away since I first dove into the world of Software Engineering. I've learned so much just in the past few months. I, along with a few others, worked together on a Web Development project that allows students to find and upload cheap and simple recipes. However, the knowledge I've gained recently goes beyond web application development. I've also learned about many fundamental software engineering conceptings such as Coding Standards, Ethics in Software Engineering, and more.

## Coding Standards
Coding standards are a common coding style that ensures clarity in the code, making it much more readable. It is also a way to keep everything organized, and everyone on the same page. I used ESLint (a coding standard tool that highlights errors in code) on my recent web development project and it has made my life much easier. When I was first introduced to ESLint, I thought it would just be an annoyance that would constantly tell me my code is wrong, which was not the case. It allowed me, and my project team members to have an understanding of each others code. Since we were all adhering to a coding standard, all of our code was straight forward and there were no confusing about our own individual code that we each contributed to the project. Coding Standards are a great tool that allows for an understanding, and proves to be beneficial especially in group settings. My recent project isn't the first, or the last time I will be working with a team on a project. I will be able to use what I now know about Coding Standards to my benefit when working on group projects in the future. 

## Ethics in Software Engineering
You can be the best coder in the world, but if you have no ethics, you will not make it. Some people's live literally depend on software, and technology in geenral. Would you trust someone to create something that your life depended on if you knew that they had no ethics or morals? This is why it's so important to understand the importance of ethics and to practice it. I, as a software engineer have a duty to prevent any harm that could arise from what I create. Ethics, however, doesn't pertain to just Software Engineering, but life in general. If everyone had no ethics, morals, or trust, where would we be? It's important to do the right thing and to think about who you could effect with anything it is that you do.
