## Learning and Growing
I've come along away since I first dove into the world of Software Engineering. I've learned so much just in the past few months. I, along with a few others, worked together on a Web Development project that allows students to find and upload cheap and simple recipes. However, the knowledge I've gained recently goes beyond web application development. I've also learned about many fundamental software engineering conceptings such as Open Source Software Development, User Inteface Frameworks, Ethics in Software Engineering, and more.
