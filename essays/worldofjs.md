## Simple yet Effective
Javascript seems to be much less restrictive than other languages. It seems very intuitive, and I have enjoyed learning about it so far. Many of the Javascript basics were very similar to that of other common languages. The main difference, however, came with the introduction of ES6. It was very different from what I was used to but in a good way. Features such as let and const, rest and spread, template strings, and destructuring are what made Javascript stand out to me. Having more flexibility and options on what you can do with a language allows you to be less limited and therefore accomplish more. I feel Javascript is an excellent language from a software engineering perspective since it seems so effective yet simple. 

## Effective Learning
I think that athletic software engineering is a great way to enhance critical thinking skills surrounding software development. In my ICS 314 course, this athletic style of learning was implemented. However, I have had only limited experience with this athletic software engineering at the time of this writing. But through the limited experience that I have had, I found it to be surprisingly enjoyable. Initially, I thought it would have been stressful, but upon actually participating in this learning style, I found that it keeps me engaged with the subject. It feels challenging yet rewarding when Iâ€™m able to complete a problem quickly. I think that this style of learning will work great for me, considering how engaging it is.
